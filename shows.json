And every person in the society comes forward to save him. Our heart and Manjeet also tried unsuccessfully to attack this monster of society, everyone has love affairs but very few dare to do love marriage. That&#39;s where our love birds showed courage... they set out to confront the society with borrowed money. The path of love is not as simple as it looks. How did they get to the point of going hungry after leaving home? How they were cheated at every step, how the institutions created to fulfill the personal interests of the society weighed them in the scale of money. Religious institutions, courts, lawyers, police cheated them for money at every step. But why ? How despite being an adult, our law made them victims of torture by not treating them as adults. Can the policemen who are sold for a few pennies correct their mistakes? How the law placed thorns in his path at every step. Whereas the law was supposed to help them. Are there so many holes in our law that illegitimate advantage is taken from the law? After all, why do educated people like Dilabar Singh Manjeet&#39;s father and Bittu Dil&#39;s maternal uncle make the issue of love marriage a question of their respect?

Manjeet&#39;s father was a head master, Bittu was a Patwari, why has the educated class not been able to free itself from such fanatical conservative ideas till date? Is today&#39;s education also bowing before conservative ideas? Who gave institutions like village panchayat the right to snatch someone&#39;s fundamental rights? Are these institutions above the law? Or is our law so weak that it has to bow before the mustaches of these institutions.
